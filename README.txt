For this tic tac toe implementation, I created a board with buttons that change image based on who is playing. The user is X, and the computer is O. The program randomizes who starts first to make it fair. I used a minimax algorithm to implement the computerâ€™s strategy. It will never lose. It only wins or ties. This algorithm is recursive, and therefore the playing is a bit laggy.
